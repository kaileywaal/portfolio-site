# Deploying changes

When making updates to site, make sure to test that the build works correctly by running `npm run build` locally.

If everything looks good, deploy to gh-pages using the command `npm run deploy`.

For some reason, deploying to gh-pages overwrites the custom domain. Go to [Repository > Settings > Pages](https://github.com/kaileywaal/portfolio-site/settings/pages) and re-add 'kaileywaal.com' as the custom domain.
